# Simple Banking Application

## Overview

This is a simple banking application built using Python, which allows users to perform basic banking operations such as:

- Viewing balance
- Depositing money
- Withdrawing money
- Exiting the program

The program keeps track of the user's balance and ensures that all transactions are valid, with checks for insufficient funds or invalid amounts.

## Features

- **Show Balance**: Displays the current balance in the account.
- **Deposit**: Allows the user to deposit an amount into the account.
- **Withdraw**: Allows the user to withdraw an amount from the account with validation for sufficient funds.
- **Exit**: Exits the program and shows a "Thank you" message.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. **Start the Program**: Run the Python script, and the menu will display with options to choose from.
2. **Choose an Option**: The user can choose one of the options to view balance, deposit money, withdraw money, or exit the application.
3. **Deposit Money**: When prompted, enter the amount you wish to deposit. The program will validate the deposit amount.
4. **Withdraw Money**: When prompted, enter the amount you wish to withdraw. The program will validate if there are sufficient funds in the account.
5. **Exit**: Choose the exit option to terminate the program.
